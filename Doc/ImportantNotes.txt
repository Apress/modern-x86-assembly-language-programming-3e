The sole purpose of the source code is to elucidate programming examples
that are directly related to the topics discussed in this book.
Minimal attention is given to essential software engineering concerns
such as robust error handling, security risks, numerical stability,
rounding errors, or ill-conditioned functions. You are responsible
for addressing these concerns should you decide to use any of the
source code in your own programs.

The Include folder contains shared C++ header files. These files
incorporate classes, templates, methods, and macros that are intended
for use with this book's source code. This code should not be used for
other purposes without proper modifications.

The VsTemplate folder contains the Visual Studio template that was
used to create the Windows source code examples.

The Scripts folder contains batch and script files to build and
execute the source code examples on both Windows and Linux.
